In the second part of the Artificial Intelligence subject we were working with concepts around the Knowledge Based Systems and the Knowledge Engineering. More specifically we delved into the Rules Based Systems.

Here you can find the system that we developed, with CLIPS using the problem solving methodology heuristic classification, to work these concepts.
The system consists in a series of rules, which for given elder characteristics, determinates a set of exercises focused on her conditions and orders them in a calendar.

To execute the program: 
> clips -f “script.sh”
